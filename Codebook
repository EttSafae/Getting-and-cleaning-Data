## Introduction

The script run_analysis.Rperforms the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set that contains ontaining subjects, activity and measurements.

2. Exctrat only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Label Appropriately the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Variables

- train, test, activitytrain, activitytest, subjecttrain and subjetest contain the data from the downloaded files.

- activity contains the merged data from features data set

- subject contains the merged data set from subject_train and subject_test data sets.

- merged is a data set containing subjects, activity and measurements

- extract contains only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, activities ans subjects.
