# Getting-and-cleaning-Data-Project

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

## Project summary
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1.Download the dataset

2.Load both the training and test datasets

3.Convert the activity and subject columns into factors

4.Merge the two datasets

5.create one data set containing subjects, activity and measurements
6.Exctrat only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
7.Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
8.Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
9.create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and 
each subject

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
